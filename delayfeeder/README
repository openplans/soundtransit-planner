To use delayfeeder:

1. edit data-sources.xml to point to some reasonable database.
2. mvn package.  Move the war file to your tomcat webapps directory
3. To load in the list of feed URLs, run:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.openplans.delayfeeder.LoadFeeds -Dexec.args=/path/to/kcmetro.txt
You can run this any time you need to update the URLs; it's idempotent.
